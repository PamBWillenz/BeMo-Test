## The Plainkit

Kirby's Plainkit is the most minimal setup you can get started with.
It does not include any content, styles or other kinds of decoration,
so it's perfect to use this as a starting point for your own project.

## The Panel

You can find the login for Kirby's admin interface at
http://yourdomain.com/panel. You will be guided through the signup
process for your first user, when you visit the panel
for the first time.

## Installation

Kirby does not require a database, which makes it very easy to
install. Just copy Kirby's files to your server and visit the
URL for your website in the browser.

**Please check if the invisible .htaccess file has been
copied to your server correctly**

### Requirements
